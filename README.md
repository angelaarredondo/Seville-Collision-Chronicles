## Sevillian Collision Chronicles
Unraveling the Patterns of Car Accidents in Seville: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Overview
This Mid Bootcamp Project seeks to identify patterns on Car Crashes in the Andalusian city of Seville, Spain for the last 20 years (2002 - . This patterns will help the city council and relevant public bodies to make decisions to avoid possible future accidents, as well as provide interesting and necessary information to insurance companies that want to make use of this information.

## Procedure
### 1. Obtaining the Data
For this project specifically, the data had to be obtained manually from scratch. In my case, I conducted a survey of 100 people of different ages and sexes to obtain the data. The aim in the future is to increase the number of people to obtain a more representative sample.

### 2. Data Processing and Drawing Insights
Statistical methods were applied to obtain relevant conclusions to be taken into account. These methods include:
- Hypothesis testing
- Statistical Inference
- Hypothesis testing
- Conditional probability: Bayes' theorem.

This will allow us to identify which factors influence an accident to take place, such as:
- Accident Location
- Age
- Gender
- Years of licence
- Speed 
- Car model, year of registration and engine capacity
- Type and condition of road
- Reason for the accident: Human factor, road condition or others

### 3. Data Visualization 
Once the data was cleaned, it was displayed in Tableau, a powerful tool for understanding, interpreting, and communicating complex data and information in a way that is clear, efficient, and engaging.

### 4. Conclusions
Once Data was processed and tested, final recommendations were done and relevant insights were brought. Check the code for further details.
